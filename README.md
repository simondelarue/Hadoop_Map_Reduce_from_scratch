# Hadoop MapReduce from scratch
A project carried out during my Post-Master's degree at Télécom Paris (INF727). 
The objective is to implement MapReduce from scratch.
This project was suggested by Rémi Sharrock - Researcher & Associate Professor @ Telecom Paris. The details about it can be found at this address : https://remisharrock.fr/courses/simple-hadoop-mapreduce-from-scratch/.
